# craftml_generator
Creates a craftml file that will render a given image with cubes.

Need python 2.7 and Pillow installed
## Usage:
```sh
$ python craftml_generator.py <DOWNSCALE FACTOR> <FILE NAME>
```

Note: Due to constraints with craftml, if the output file is over ~3000 lines it will not work very well. Sorry :(
